### IMPORTANT NOTE

This used to be a fork of [sdias's "Windows 10 Virtual Desktop Enhancer"](https://github.com/sdias/win-10-virtual-desktop-enhancer) so as to track my own little modifications that I'd been using for years. With the release of Autohotkey v2, however, I switched to use of [VD.ahk](https://github.com/FuPeiJiang/VD.ahk) (specifically, its ahk v2 port) and discarded pretty much everything of that project except the tray icons it provided.

So now all this is is me keeping track of my own hotkeys and the scheme I use for navigating between four virtual desktops.
